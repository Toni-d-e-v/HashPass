# HashPass

You can download it from official firefox website: [HashPass(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hashpass/)]

On one click hashes your password before you input it. It's a simple and secure way to use simple passwords.
For hashing we use in house built hashing algorithm that is very fast and secure and allways outputs 53-byte string.
This should work on most websites, if you think you can improve HashPass be free to open an issue on GitHub.
